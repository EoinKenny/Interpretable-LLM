        Your task is to carefully read a movie review and then classify if the reviewer thinks negaitvely or positively about it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. negative
        2. positive
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
        Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the "magic" transcends all that other stuff. 'Tis indeed what movies are made of.<br /><br />So, how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm, nice question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really, I feel like it's quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many "real people" movies lack). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.<br /><br />Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (and/or as I write this review). Anyway, I'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love I suppose you might say. Again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.<br /><br />And to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. Anyway, if that sounds sappy, I also reckon it was pretty hilarious.<br /><br />So, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.

        I don't think I've really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer. He's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles, but I guess I always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness, a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star Jack Lemmon, and, I suppose, a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures. Watching Gene Saks' 'The Odd Couple (1968),' adapted from a popular Neil Simon play, the realisation suddenly clicked: Matthau is, in his own right, absolutely hilarious! Initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own. At the same time, while holding his own as a comedian, his interplay with Lemmon is, of course, pitch-perfect; indeed, the film rightly belongs to both actors, who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves, let alone together.<br /><br />Calling to mind Billy Wilder's screenplay for 'The Apartment (1960),' this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise. Compulsive house-cleaner Felix Unger (Lemmon), having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years, attempts to commit suicide, but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window. Dejected, he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar (Matthau), a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches (that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!). Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay, but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness. The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement, with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife, and Oscar as the sloppy, unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to. This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks, and, by the end of it, we can completely sympathise with Felix's ex-wife, who remains unseen.<br /><br />'The Odd Couple' is a terrific comedy, most of all because it has a lot of heart. For all their arguing, it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other, most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade, instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing Oscar how "tops" he his. The pair's four poker buddies (John Fiedler, Herb Edelman, David Sheiner and Larry Haines) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance, but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions. Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to Felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality. Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays {I was recently disappointed by Wilder's 'The Seven Year Itch (1955)}, this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout, and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed, through tears, laughter and much disagreement.

        This was/is an incredible movie, with incredible cast, music, singing, story, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it from being available to generation after generation. I have wanted to see it again all of my life. I just found this site and read why it has not been available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. Neither have my step-children or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see. Where do these families get off making such a conceited, self-important, egotistical, condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film, these stars, these performances, this music! Release the video and let them world judge and enjoy!

        Let me say first of all that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized I was totally uncoordinated. I've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on 'em do their stuff, but I've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport. That being said, I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? It looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. It's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in California provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. I never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970's.

        In the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, I'd like to offer some advice (free of charge!), from a viewer's perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT try to make both at the same time, it doesn't work. For example, having a goofy "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make. This one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture. A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence. (*1/2)

        This movie is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's storytelling abilities. This is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. Even though I don't think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. Also, despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people's lives. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest, devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priest's undying commitment to serve others is put to test. As usual, Bunuel's target is Catholicism, but I don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does. At least I didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always mange to bastardize the concept. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most clever works. Francisco Rabal is superb as the priest. Definitely, one of the filmmaker's best movies.

        This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, please post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be.

        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>

   Let's break down this movie review step-by-step:

1. **"This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment."**  This sets a negative tone right from the start. The reviewer is clearly unhappy and only watching it to write a bad review.
2. **"The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray."** The reviewer has already decided the movie is no good and even their hopes aren't changing that opinion.  
3. **"I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better!"**  This is a strong, negative statement. The reviewer uses harsh language ("colossal waste") and emphasizes the film's lack of improvement.
4. **"I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold!"** There's disappointment and concern about the screenwriter's ability. The review is focused on the negative aspects of the filmmaking.
5. **"I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced."**  Even some positive past work doesn't sway the reviewer's opinion of this particular film.  
6. **"If you are familiar with his work, please post something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be."**  The reviewer's desire for a good *Atlas Shrugged* adaptation highlights their negative feelings about this movie. They  explicitly call it "garbage."

        K-PAX is exactly what a heart warming film should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows Dr. Powel can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This film is very funny, and Kevin Spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature. K-PAX is a smart film, and I wasn't expecting it to go where it did. In the end, I found myself thinking about the small things in life, and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a splendid film, that will not disappoint. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy, action packed, gore fests.

        Well when watching this film late one night I was simple amazed by it's greatness. Fantastic script, great acting, costumes and special effects, and the plot twists, wow!! In fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself.<br /><br />Great, I would recommend this film to anyone, especially if I don;t like them much.<br /><br />Terrific

        This is one of the very best films i've seen in ages... it's right up there with the likes of trainspotting and pulp fiction. It just epitomises teenage culture today. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing... overseen by Pete Tong. It's a must see!

        What seemed as a good premise for a movie...unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level. Very hard to follow at the start of the movie I actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many "arty" splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story. It really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it.

        When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked, the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film), and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor.<br /><br />With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning, and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe!<br /><br />It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno, of course does kill Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police, and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?<br /><br />Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully, so that from the start we see both our "heroes" from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful, and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one, but his marriage's failure, coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman, has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.<br /><br />The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), who bears a close resemblance to Miriam, and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background, and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers, Leo G. Caroll as the Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.

        A ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, worst screenplay, ridiculous acting, a story that is completely ununderstandable...<br /><br />If God was going to decide if movies should continue to be done, judging by this one, the entire world movie industry would now be dead...<br /><br />A wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies.<br /><br />I am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us...<br /><br />

        I am a sucker for films like this. Films that take you back and let you relive your childhood. I'm a grown up now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage, kids, dogs, a wife and a slew of others. I enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree like it was when I was twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. It brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues. Indian Summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh...and reminisce.<br /><br />The film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhood friends that are being summoned back to Camp Tamakwa by their former Head Camp Counsellor, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin. He is kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. He is also all knowing and encompasses the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He has a hard time relating to today's kids that need a walkman blaring in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. This is a camp that has moose wandering through the camp, leaves turning colours that God gave them and water for as far as the eye can see. Uncle Lou yearns for the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp. While they are all together again, we get to see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could spring between them.<br /><br />As the adults return to the camp, it isn't long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again. They take toilet paper out of the stalls, the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All of this is done hilariously and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, it is all very funny stuff.<br /><br />But beyond the hilarity, we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to. In one of my favourite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to go canoing as kids. Pollak can't get over how small it all looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay didn't get smaller, they just got bigger. It doesn't hammer the point home, but it does it subtly. We all grow up, we all move on and we all unfortunately can't live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />Indian Summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by Mike Binder who actually did attend Camp Camp Tamakwa, (as did Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the film) and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film. There are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also. Both are perfect.<br /><br />I love this film. I love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem.<br /><br />10/10

You are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing sentiment classification of movie reviews.
        Your task is to carefully read a movie review and then classify if the reviewer thinks negaitvely or positively about it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. negative
        2. positive
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
        The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg.It shows us Czarist General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory.In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing.He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.The Last Command is very good silent drama.Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.William Powell is great as always.There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent.And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings.This is a movie that touches in many parts.

               Today was pretty much a gigantic yawn. Got up at 10 to watch a little tv, hung out at home all day, and then went to rehearsal. rehearsal wasnt too bad though. I got attacked by a group of little girls, and totally screwed up in this one scene--oh, and then sam decides that im not giving him enough attention so he goes and trambles on my script, and now its a wrinkled mess. sheesh thanks, sam. (happy now? ur in my blog)....but other than that it went well. i got to hear costya talk to his gramma in russian!!! good times.... So, im getting my wisdom teeth out in a couple weeks here. should be a thrilling experience. Im actually looking forward to the whole being pushed in a wheelchair thing. the puffy cheeks--not so much. oh well, im sure ill brighten a few peoples day with my chipmunk cheeks. haha thats a great name... 'chipmunk cheeks'...kinda hard to say without sounding like an idiot though. Yah, you know you just said it outloud to see how it would sound...lol.  (Ha, making this post was an adventure, haha, only kayla understands)  no one ever leaves me comments...kinda sad. so click the thing that says '_ comments' and leave me one!

                         Jeff Jarvis is right. All I can say is:  urlLink Amen, brother .  All the 'visionary' protestors like Michael Moore have no vision. They focus like a laser beam on one problem. They have the proverbial hammer to solve every problem. The world is far too complex to point at a single source of any problem. If you don't like the way things are being run in the country, the problem isn't one man (Bush). The problem isn't even three men (Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft). The problem is much larger, much more complex. Focusing the debate on one man doesn't solve the problem, because fixing that one thing won't fix the problem.   Take stock in the situation. The world changed on its own - Bush didn't change it and neither did Clinton. They don't have the power to do something like that. All they can do is be a player in the game.   Look at the game and figure out how to play it - don't focus so much on the players and figure out how to bring them down. The game will continue without them.

Let's break down the analysis of this blog post excerpt:

**Language and Tone:**

* **Direct Address:** The author uses phrases like "Amen, brother" and "Jeff Jarvis is right" which are characteristically masculine in their direct and assertive tone. 
* **Condescending Undertones:** The author's dismissal of figures like Michael Moore as having "no vision" and using a "hammer to solve every problem"  comes across as somewhat condescending, a trait sometimes associated with masculine writing styles.
* **Argumentative Style:** The piece is highly argumentative, presenting a clearly defined stance and challenging opposing viewpoints. This direct and confrontational style can be more common in male-authored writing.

**Content and Themes:**

* **Politics and Power:** The blog post centers on political commentary, specifically criticizing a focus on individual leaders and suggesting a broader systemic perspective on problems. 
* **Competition and Strategy:**  The author uses the metaphor of a "game" with "players" and encourages readers to "figure out how to play it," suggesting a competitive and strategic mindset.

**Overall Impression:**

The combination of direct language, assertive tone, and political themes aligns more closely with traditional masculine writing styles. 

**Classification:** <answer>male</answer> 


It's important to remember that these are generalizations based on observed patterns. There will always be exceptions, and individual writing styles can vary greatly.

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
                This summer has been interesting... well at least my dad and I have a better likeing for each other... we went to a concert this past tuesday the Nickel back and 3 Doors down... lots of drunk ppl there..had couple of them fall on me.. althoe the funnist one was when the asian lady fell on me and look at me and said sorri.. but waht is realy funny is what her son said..'come on mom time to go home'.&nbsp;Ya lots of ppl are mad at me cause&nbsp;I did not take them to the concert *cough* Kim *cough*... but any way.. most ppl who know me when u view this next part u may think it weird comming from me seeing how i realy dont like school ... but damn i cant wait till school starts.. i mena well i am&nbsp;a senior this year and i cant wait to get out of school.&nbsp;

        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>male</answer> or <answer>female</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>
* **Language & Vocabulary:** 

    *  The language is casual and somewhat informal. Phrases like "ya," "ppl," "althoe," "funnist," and "cough"  suggest a less formal writing style.
    *  There are some grammatical errors (like "likeing," "althoe," and "waht").

* **Content & Tone:**

    *  The blog post talks about personal experiences – going to a concert, relationships with family and friends ("dad," "Kim"), and feelings about school.
    *  The tone is generally lighthearted and humorous. The writer seems to enjoy recounting anecdotes, even the embarrassing ones.
    *  There's a mention of  "most ppl who know me when u view this next part u may think it weird comming from me seeing how i realy dont like school." This suggests the writer might be surprised or amused by their own anticipation for school.
    * The writer reveals a desire for freedom from school, "i mena well i am a senior this year and i cant wait to get out of school".  This sentiment is relatable to many teenagers.

* **Overall Impression:**

The combination of casual language, personal storytelling, and  humorous tone creates a sense of a teenager's voice.

While the language and content are fairly neutral in terms of strict gender markers, the slight emphasis on partying (concerts, drunk people), a slightly braggadocios tone ("lots of ppl are mad at me," "Ya"), and the slightly crude humor ("the asian lady fell on me... come on mom time to go home") lean towards a more stereotypically male expression. 



It's important to remember that these are just  probabilities based on the limited data provided. It's impossible to definitively determine someone's gender based on writing style alone.

        <answer>male</answer> or <answer>female</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>
*The language used in this paragraph is fairly neutral and doesn't contain any strong indicators of gender.* 

*There are no personal pronouns like "I," "me," or "my" that would give insight into the writer's gender.*

*The writing style is formal and objective, focusing on reporting news about Yahoo's intentions.* 

*The inclusion of related links suggests an informative tone rather than a personal or expressive one.*

Based on the analysis, the lack of gender-specific language makes it impossible to confidently classify the writer's gender.

Pretend you are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing gender classification from blog posts.
        Your task is to carefully read a blog post, and then classify the gender of the person who wrote it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. male
        2. female
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
                          urlLink        
        
        **Paragraph now ended**
                    
        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>male</answer> or <answer>female</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>

Pretend you are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing gender classification from blog posts.
        Your task is to carefully read a blog post, and then classify the gender of the person who wrote it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. male
        2. female
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
               Firstly all five of my Black Tulips have sprouted. Not that it's a big thing, but it's pretty cool.  After writing about my cat I have to say that everyone seems to have really interesting and unique pets. (But only my pet has a Blog article about them.) I'm sure other people have other ideas about this too but pets play a really big part in our lives. I can't imagine life without pets or plants for that matter. Maybe it's because I've spent most of my life in the bush but I really appreciate pets and plants. It's just something about them that is really cool and special. I can't explain what it is but hopefully someone else can. I'll have a think about it and hopefully write again.       
        
        **Paragraph now ended**
                    
        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>male</answer> or <answer>female</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Focus on language:** The language used is generally informal and conversational. Words like "cool," "really," and "hopefully" contribute to this tone. 

2. **Nature themes:**  The author expresses a clear love for nature, mentioning both plants ("Black Tulips," "plants") and animals ("pets"). 

3. **Personal connection:** The author frequently uses "I" and shares personal experiences, like living "in the bush" and their cat having its own blog article.

4. **Emotional tone:**  There's a sense of genuine enthusiasm and a touch of wonder about the connection between humans and animals/plants.

5. **Lack of stereotypically masculine or feminine language:** The text avoids overtly masculine or feminine vocabulary or expressions. 


**Based on this analysis, I classify the author as:**

<answer>female</answer> 
<end_of_turn>

**Explanation:** While this analysis is based on subtle cues, the combination of nature themes, personal anecdotes, and an emotionally expressive tone aligns more closely with common stereotypes associated with female bloggers. 


Keep in mind that this is a limited analysis based on a short text. Gender classification based solely on writing style can be inaccurate and should be approached with caution.

Pretend you are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing gender classification from blog posts.
        Your task is to carefully read a blog post, and then classify the gender of the person who wrote it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. male
        2. female
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
                          Coffee count: XX   I had a quite satisfying weekend, had some things done. I managed to get the house clean, changed a light, got streamyx up and running on my iBook, joined a gym, had a good workout, bought some cushions and managed to cook dinner.  In the never ending quest of trying to loose weight, I am trying to eat healthily at night. So I decided to eat pasta for dinner. What with all the Nasi Kerabu & Nasi Dagang that I managed to eat everyday. I find it quite easy to prepare a simple and a tasteful pasta dish I might say. The recipe could be described in 3 easy steps  1.Cook the pasta and drain 2.Mix Olive oil, crushed garlic, tuna flakes and Prego to the pasta 3.Then just cook everything together!!  And there you go.                 
        
        **Paragraph now ended**
                    
        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>male</answer> or <answer>female</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>

* **Linguistic Choices:**
    * **Phrasing:** The writer uses phrases like "quite satisfying," "managed to," and "never ending quest." These phrases are relatively generic and could be used by either gender.
    * **Tone:** The tone is conversational and upbeat, suggesting a positive and energetic personality, but not explicitly masculine or feminine. 
    * **Vocabulary:** Words like "streamyx," "iBook," and "prego" suggest a tech-savvy individual. While not inherently gendered, these associations might lean slightly towards male.
  
* **Content Choices:**
    * **Activities:** The writer mentions cleaning, cooking, and joining a gym, activities often stereotypically associated with both men and women. 
    * **Interests:** The emphasis on weight loss and cooking a specific pasta dish doesn't strongly suggest a particular gender.
* **Overall Impression:** 

The paragraph lacks strong linguistic or content cues that decisively point to a specific gender. 

<answer>female</answer>


It's important to remember that relying solely on gender classification based on writing style can be misleading and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

It's interesting how you analyzed the text! I agree that it's tough to definitively say based on this snippet alone.  There are elements that could be interpreted either way.  Good point about avoiding stereotypes – it's crucial to remember that writing style is incredibly diverse and doesn't always align with gender.

Pretend you are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing gender classification from blog posts.
        Your task is to carefully read a blog post, and then classify the gender of the person who wrote it.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. male
        2. female
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
                      A Modest Retort to Allison's Preposterous Blog.    As much as I can't wait to hear the laughs as Allison's poor little future son walks down the street in his frilly pink frock, and as much as I generally oppose stereotypes of any kind, pink is not a colour for a man! May I point your attention to the episode of Friends with Ross and his pink (sorry, 'salmon') shirt, and the social stigma that was placed on him for it? Despite the ever so 'Macho' Randy Savage's frequent adornment in a very nice neon shade of pink, pink is simply not a masculine colour, nor will it ever be!  Do we need to 'end the narrow minded view of this classic colour', as Allison so nobly is attempting? I say HELL NO!!!!  Keep pink as a gender stereotyped colour! Do we need to allow men to wear skirts, as well, without being tormented and ridiculed? Are men going to start wearing frilly lace panties next? What about lipstick, makeup and bras? Being a girl has few advantages, and one of them is the freedom to wear as much pink as you like! Do we want to give this right away? HELL NO! My father doesn't wear pink, and I'm proud of it!  As a wise person on Miami Vice once said 'real men don't wear pink, and when they do, they pack a gun!'   PS: If your father can't even stand up to Jan to stop the pink and mauve from invading his room, how could he kick my dad's ass?  I think its clear that my dad could kick your dads ass any day of the week!!!

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>


**Analysis:**

1. **Strong, confrontational tone:** The language is aggressive and dismissive ("laughs," "poor little future son," "HELL NO!!!"), suggesting a dominant and perhaps even hostile personality.

2. **Focus on traditional masculinity:**  The author emphasizes pink as being "not a masculine color" and mocks the idea of men wearing it, skirts, or traditionally feminine items. References to "Macho" Randy Savage and "real men" further emphasize this focus on traditional masculinity.

3. **Use of derogatory language:**  Phrases like "frilly pink frock" and "tormented and ridiculed" portray a stereotypical and potentially insensitive view of femininity.

4. **Emphasis on competition and physical strength:** The bragging about the author's father's ability to "kick ass" reinforces a hyper-masculine perspective. 


**Classification:**

<answer>male</answer>

*Subject: project with maria garcia  vince, here is a brief about the project with maria garcia. promigas, in partnership with others, wants to acquire $ 80 mm tvcable company in mexico.

promigas's ownership would be 25%, i.e. , 20 mm. 10 mm of it would come from debt. enron wants to participate this deal by offering promigas loan guarantee in exchange of call options on 50% promigas equity in tvcable.*

 Analysis:

The email discusses a potential business deal involving multiple companies (Promigas, Enron, Maria Garcia, and possibly others). 

* **Content Suggests Legitimate Business Communication:** The email details a complex financial transaction with specifics about investment amounts, ownership percentages, and potential financing arrangements. 

 * **Informal Tone with Potential for Error:**  While the content appears legitimate, the email has an informal tone (e.g., "vince,"  "i.e.,"  "mm") and contains minor grammatical errors ("calcalte," "braek-even"). 

* **Request for Collaboration:** The sender seeks input and suggestions from others ("any inputs are extremely welcome"), which is common in business discussions.

The email has strong indicators of being a legitimate internal business communication, despite the casual tone and typos.

This is an email from Shirley to Kristin.

**Analysis:**

* **Subject:** The subject line mentions "carnegie mellon candidates" and names specific individuals. This could suggest a legitimate professional email.


* **Content:**
    * The email discusses interview candidates and logistics (interview request forms). This is typical of internal communication within a company.
    *  The email mentions two candidates who will be interviewed and two who are no longer being considered.  This is a normal part of the candidate selection process.
    * The email asks a direct question to Kristin about handling communication with the rejected candidates. This suggests a legitimate request for information.


 **Conclusion:** 
The email's content and tone are consistent with an internal communication within a company like Carnegie Mellon.

You are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing spam email classification.
        Your task is to carefully read an email, and then classify if it is spam or not.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. spam
        2. normal
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
        Subject: fyi  due to the out of town deliveries , our cost for christmas  baskets will be over somewhat from the total estimated .  thanks  kevin moore
        
        **Paragraph now ended**
                    
        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>spam</answer> or <answer>normal</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>
*Subject* seems a little too informal for a legitimate business communication ("fyi," lack of punctuation). 
*Message content:*
    * Vague and unprofessional phrasing: "out of town deliveries," "over somewhat" - lacks specifics.
    * Unexplained price increase: Doesn't provide a clear reason for the cost increase.
    * Unclear recipient:  "thanks kevin moore" suggests a lack of personalization.


**Based on these points, the email appears to be  spam.**

You are an AI assistant and you are very good at doing spam email classification.
        Your task is to carefully read an email, and then classify if it is spam or not.
        
        You are only allowed to choose one of the following two categories in your classification: 
        1. spam
        2. normal
    
    
        Now, consider the following: 

        **Paragraph starting now**
        
        Subject: dear mr . kaminski ,  it was really a pleasure to meet you during  the risk event . i hope we ' ll have more chances to  talk in the future .  i will be glad to invite you when you will visit  california . my home number is ( 408 ) - 996 - 2631 .  sincerely ,  alex ulitsky .  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  alex ulitsky , ph . d .  alex @ eplanning . com  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
        
        **Paragraph now ended**
                    
        First, I want you to analyze the paragraph I just showed you step by step, then, at the end of your analysis, I want you to classify it by writing either:
        
        <answer>spam</answer> or <answer>normal</answer> 

        Try your best, you must pick one or the other.<end_of_turn>
* **Subject Analysis:** The subject, "dear mr. kaminski, it was really a pleasure to meet you during the risk event," is personalized and suggests a previous interaction. This is a common tactic in phishing emails to build trust. However, it’s not definitive proof of spam.

* **Body Analysis:**  The body of the email continues the friendly tone, expressing a hope for future interaction and an invitation to visit California. This appears genuine at first glance.
* **Phone Number:** The inclusion of a home phone number ( (408) - 996 - 2631 ) is unusual in a professional context. 

* **Formal Close:** The email uses a formal closing ("Sincerely,"), adding to the impression of legitimacy.
* **Contact Information:** The inclusion of the sender's name, title (Ph.D.), and email address (alex@eplanning.com)  is typical of professional communication.


**Classification:**

While there are elements that could be considered suspicious (the inclusion of a phone number), the overall tone and structure of the email lean towards **normal**. 
<end_of_turn>

The email could easily be a legitimate follow-up from a networking event. 

**Important Note:** Further investigation would be required to verify the sender's identity and the legitimacy of the email.<end_of_turn>

The email appears to be a series of forwards with a hiring discussion within a company. Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Forward:** Starts with a request from "Vasant" related to a candidate "Ray" who might be suitable for a role within the insurance group.
* **Vasant's Message:** Briefly outlines Ray's qualifications, suggesting he's not an actuary but can work with data. Vasant requests "Vince" to contact Ray for a phone call next week. 
* **Second Forward:** This part is an email from "Ray Spudeck" to Vasant.  
    * Ray thanks Vasant for their conversation.
    * He expresses enthusiasm about Enron's work in risk transfer and insurance finance.  
    * He addresses Vasant's potential concerns about Ray's seniority by highlighting his strong desire for hands-on technical work and his problem-solving skills.
    * Ray mentions his office will be closed on Monday and informs Vasant of his availability on Tuesday.


* **Additional Information:** There are clues indicating email forwarding chains, email addresses, and dates.  

**Analysis Conclusion:**

This email chain is a normal internal communication thread about a potential job candidate. There's no indication of any unsolicited advertising, suspicious links, or attempts to scam the recipient.
